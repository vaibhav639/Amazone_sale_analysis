# Objective:
To analyze sales performance data across different platforms.
To investigate the geographical distribution of sales in North America, Europe, Japan, and other regions.
To understand the impact of genres and publishers on global sales trends.
To build a Tableau dashboard that visually represents this information for easy interpretation.

# Data Analysis:
The dataset contains the following columns:

Rank: The position of the product in terms of sales volume.
Name: The name of the product.
Platform: The platform on which the product is sold (e.g., Xbox, PlayStation, etc.).
